# For Owners...

## Business parameters:

  * Horse Ranch constraints on properties
    * Number of Acres
      * Minimum:  2; because less than that is not really enough for barn, horse arena, etc
      * Maximum:  100,000; because anything entered larger than that is very likely a mistake
    * Horse Capacity; number of horses that can be kept on property
      * Minimum:  2; because no fun riding alone
      * Maximum:  1,000; because anything larger is likely a mistake
    * People Capacity; number of subscriber people who can be accommodated at once...taking into account parking, etc.
      * Minimum:  2; because no fun riding alone
      * Maximum:  100; because anything larger is likely a mistake
    *  Subscription Price; should be rounded to whole dollars
      * Minimum $100; because anything less is not practical
      * Maximum $100,000; because even if 5 people stayed continuously for a year, that is an almost incredibly high price
    * Ranch Name Min/max
      * Minimum:  5 characters, no restriction on type
      * Maximum:  10 characters
    * Ranch Description; Should provide all the information a prospect should want before calling for more information
      * Minimum:  5 characters
      * Maximum:  250 characters
      

## Other Business notes:

* A single subscriber represents the payer and up to 4 guests for any visit.  More than four would require special permission
